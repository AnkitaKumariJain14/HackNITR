# The Invincible Gut 

Hospitals have to cater to a large number of patients, especially during the times of a pandemic. 
People with common diseases have to wait in long queues to get their diagnosis done by the doctors. 
Handling a large number of patients requires huge number of people to be employed with tons of facilities that need to be provided. 
It also requires excessive amount of time for processing the data and receiving proper care.
The Invincible Gut is your friendly health app that helps narrow down the type of disease based on common symptoms (listed on the webpage) and then further detect if the person has the disease or not based on disease specific inputs obtained from the user. 
The application then generates a report with the prediction and health advisory along with the details of the department the subject can approach.
At present , Invincible Gut predicts Diabetes, Malaria , Insect Bites, Covid-19, Hypo/Hyperthyroidism,and Pneumonia.

## Advantages:
The Application has been developed to help ease the workload of doctors.
It provides accurate prediction models for easier diagnostics. 
It can help reduce waiting time at hospitals.
It also provides higher throughput as numerous patients can avail this service at the same time.

## Future Development:
Adding more disease like Cataract detection using Retina images classification, Brain tumor detection and classification, heart attack etc.
Creating a GUI based application or Web page for easy access of the models.
Improving the model performances to achieve higher accuracies and better predictions.
